I designed and developed the website for the 2024–25 Viz Industry Fair (VIF), which is an annual Texas A&M event aimed at guiding students toward successful careers.
Over the course of the school year, it offers portfolio reviews, mock interviews, professionalism workshops, talks and presentations, and fair days—ALL involving industry professionals.
The official website is https://www.vizindustryfair.com/.

I have been part of the VIF committee since Fall 2021, when I first volunteered to build the website for the 2022 fair (https://github.com/NkemdiAnyiam/VIF-2022-Site). I love coding/designing as well as finding opportunities to help other students in general, so being able to build these sites from scratch and help with such a huge event is something I am very proud of.
